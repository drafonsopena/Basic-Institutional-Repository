<p>
Institutional Repositories  are digital collections of archives used for keeping the intellectual output of a single or multi-university community. These intellectual output include research papers,  monographs, academic articles, Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs), and other digital assets published during an academic year. IRs can have many forms and serve a variety of purposes. IUM-RPER focuses on a digital library that stores the research output of all academic levels offered in the Faculty of Information and Technology like Bachelors, Honor Degree, Masters and Doctorate.

<h1>Proven &amp; Reputable Track Record</h1>

<p>
 Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
